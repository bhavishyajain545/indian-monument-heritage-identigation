Indian Monument Heritage Identification
Preserve, Promote, and Identify India's Architectural Marvels Using Deep Learning!

Introduction
Indiaâ€™s rich heritage includes iconic monuments like the Taj Mahal, Qutub Minar, and more. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize these monuments from images, aiming to support education, tourism, and cultural preservation.

Features
Automated recognition of Indian monuments from images.
Transfer learning for high classification accuracy.
Easy-to-customize architecture to include new datasets or classes.
Interactive prediction interface for user uploads.
How It Works
Dataset
Organized with images of Indian monuments, grouped into class-specific folders.

Model

Uses a CNN architecture enhanced by transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
Optimized using Adam with advanced learning rate strategies.
Training & Predictions

Train the model with your dataset.
Test and predict images to identify monuments with confidence.
